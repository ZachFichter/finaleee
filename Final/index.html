      From the inventive minds of Lost executive producers Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis comes a bold new imagining of the world, where fairy tales and the modern-day are about to collide.</p>
  
    <p class="Homep"> they all lived happily ever after - or so everyone
      was led to believe. Emma Swan knows how to take care of herself.
      She's a 28-year-old bail bonds collector who's been on her own
      ever since she was abandoned as a baby. But when the son she 
      gave up years ago finds her, everything starts to change.
      Henry is now 10 years old and in desperate need of Emma's 
      help. He believes that Emma actually comes from an alternate
      world and is Snow White and Prince Charming's missing daughter.
      According to his book of fairytales, they sent her away to protect
      her from the Evil Queen's curse, which trapped the fairytale world
      forever, frozen in time, and brought them into our modern world.</p>
  
    <p class="Homep"> Of course Emma doesn't believe a word, but when she 
      brings Henry back to Storybrooke, she finds herself drawn to this 
      unusual boy and his strange New England town. Concerned for Henry, 
      she decides to stay for a while, but she soon suspects that 
      Storybrooke is more than it seems. It's a place where magic has 
      been forgotten, but is still powerfully close... where fairytale 
      characters are alive, even though they don't remember who they once 
      were. The epic battle for the future of all worlds is beginning, but 
      for good to win, Emma will have to accept her destiny and fight like 
      hell.</p>
